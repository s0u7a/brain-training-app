# Brain Training App - Walkthrough

I have built a **Dual N-Back** brain training application using **Node.js**, **React (Vite)**, and **Bun**.

## Features
- **Dual N-Back Game**: A scientifically supported memory training task.
- **Premium Aesthetic**: Dark mode design with modern colors and fonts.
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile (responsive grid).
- **Audio Feedback**: Uses the Web Speech API for letter sounds.

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    bun run build
    bun start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Play
1.  Click **Start Game**.
2.  A square will appear in the grid, and a letter will be spoken.
3.  **Position Match**: If the square is in the same position as it was **N** steps ago, press **A** or click "Position Match".
4.  **Sound Match**: If the letter is the same as it was **N** steps ago, press **L** or click "Sound Match".
5.  **N-Level**: You can adjust the N-level (1-Back, 2-Back, etc.) on the start screen.

## Verification
- **Visuals**: Check if the grid highlights correctly.
- **Audio**: Ensure your volume is up to hear the letters.
- **Scoring**: Verify that correct matches increase your score and mistakes decrease it.

## Next Steps
- Add more game modes.
- Implement persistent high scores (Database integration).
- Add user accounts.
